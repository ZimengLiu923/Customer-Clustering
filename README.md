# Customer-Clustering

This repository contains the analysis and findings of a machine learning project focused on clustering credit card customers. The goal of the project was to segment customers into different clusters based on their spending behaviors.

## Dataset
The dataset for this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ZimengLiu923/Customer-Clustering/blob/main/credit_card.csv).

## Context
In this project, I applied various clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments within the dataset. By clustering customers, we could gain insights into their behavior, which could be leveraged for targeted marketing strategies.

Key information about the project:
- Missing Data Imputation: The dataset contained missing values, which were imputed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This step ensured the dataset's integrity for further analysis.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the dataset's dimensionality to 10 components while retaining as much variance as possible.
- Clustering: K-Means and Agglomerative clustering were used to group the customers into 7 distinct segments based on their usage patterns.

## Findings

Based on the analysis of the data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Customer Segments Identified: The analysis identified 7 distinct clusters of customers, each with unique characteristics and spending patterns.

2. Cluster Interpretation: Each cluster was analyzed to understand the common traits among its members, such as high spenders in luxury categories or customers who are likely to churn.

3. Market Strategy: These segments can be used to tailor marketing strategies, such as personalized offers and loyalty programs, to enhance customer engagement and retention.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations can be made:

Implement Targeted Marketing: Develop specific marketing campaigns for each customer segment. For example, offer rewards to high spenders to encourage continued usage or provide incentives to infrequent users to increase their engagement.

Product Customization: Tailor credit card products to meet the needs of different segments. For instance, create a card with lower interest rates for customers who maintain high balances.

Customer Retention: Focus on retaining high-value segments by offering personalized rewards and superior customer service. Consider additional experimentation to refine these strategies further.
